# Statements and Confirms

## **Requirements**

Under the FINRA and SEC rules, Alpaca is required to ensure the customer
statements and trade confirms are delivered correctly in time to the end
customers. That being said, the actual communication and delivery do not have to
be done by Alpaca directly. Very often, you want to own the full user
experiences and to be responsible for these communications, which is totally
possible.

## **Document API Integration**

You can retrieve the generated reports in PDF format through [Document API]({{<
relref "/api-references/broker-api/documents/_index.md" >}}). You can store the files
on your storage if it is required for your regulation purpose, or you can let
your customers download the files using the URL returned in the API response. If
you are a fully-disclosed broker-dealer, you can insert your firm logo, name and
address in the PDF template. Please send those data to Alpaca.

If you need even more customization on the template, we are currently working on
the new API endpoint which will return only the data points so that you can
build fully-customized documents with your own template. Alpaca still needs to
review your final version of customized documents before delivering to the end
customers for the first time.
